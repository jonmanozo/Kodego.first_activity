                <p>
                    The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
                    It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
                    and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
                     HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
                    
                    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may 
                    be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text
                    such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
                    Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p and p surround and provide 
                    information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the 
                    content of the page.
                    
                    HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. 
                    The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and 
                    current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, 
                    known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the canvas element, together with JavaScript.

                <p>
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such 
                    as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside 
                    HTML and JavaScript.[2]

                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve 
                    content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages 
                    to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; 
                    and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

                    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, 
                    such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules 
                    for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

                    The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular 
                    element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

                    The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with 
                    CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]

                    In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in GTK widget toolkit.

                    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, 
                    longside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party 
                    libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

                    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based 
                    object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has 
                    application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

                    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser 
                    or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

                    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most 
                    popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

                    Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

                <p>
                    PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development.[8] It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf 
                    in 1993 and released in 1995.[9][10] The PHP reference implementation is now produced by the PHP Group.[11] PHP was originally an abbreviation of 
                    Personal Home Page,[12][13] but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[14]

                    PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. 
                    On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code—which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data—would 
                    form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist that can be employed 
                    to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as 
                    standalone graphical applications[15] and robotic drone control.[16] PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.

                    The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be 
                    deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.[17]

                    The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the de facto 
                    standard that other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.[18]

                    W3Techs reports that as of January 2023, "PHP is used by 77.8% of all the websites whose server-side programming language we know."[19] It also 
                    reports that only 8% of PHP users use the currently supported 8.x versions. Most use unsupported PHP 7, more specifically PHP 7.4, while 23% use PHP 5, 
                    which is not supported with security fixes and is known to have serious security vulnerabilities. This does not necessarily indicate that these websites 
                    are vulnerable, though, since Linux distributions such as Debian provide security patches for unsupported versions of PHP.[20]
